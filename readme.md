# My Journey with AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

In this project, I completed the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge by leveraging various AWS services and CI/CD tools. 

The steps involved creating a portfolio using HTML/CSS, hosting the static website on an S3 bucket, configuring Route 53 for DNS management, securing the site with SSL/TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager, and setting up CloudFront for efficient content delivery. 

Additionally, I implemented a Lambda function to track the number of visitors and stored the data in DynamoDB. 

To automate the deployment process, I used GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment and Terraform for infrastructure as code to manage the Lambda and DynamoDB resources.
